# SecureMail

This is a Java library for encrypting multipart emails with `PGP` or `S/MIME`. This library was conceived in order to 
address the need to encrypt using asymmetric keys. While most of the popular mail providers secure 
the mail transmission with SSL (mostly HTTPS), this generally does not provide end to end encryption - the mail provider
server will see the unencrypted mail -. By using these standards it is possible to generate encrypted mails that only 
the end receiver will be able to read.

The library supports:

- `S/MIME`: supported by most of the email clients like Outlook. 
In this case, the _BouncyCastle_ implementation of `S/MIME` has been reused.

- `PGP`: less wildly used and supported by some open source mail clients like Thunderbird. In this case, the implementation is done following the 
standard described on the [RFC3156](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3156) document.

## Usage
In order to use the library it is only necessary to import the project as it is and then add the project as a _Maven_ 
dependency in the project to be used.

Due to the simplicity of the library, it is very straight forward to use. Only two steps are neccesary:

1. Use the factory to get the desired mail encryptor instance. 
    - By type: the type of encryptor will be implicitly indicate on the _type_ field.
        ```
        // SMIME encryptor
        EncryptMailFactory factory = new EncryptMailFactory(EncryptMailFactory.SMIME, key_smime);
        EncryptMail encryptor_smime = factory.getEncryptor();
      
        // PGP encryptor
        EncryptMailFactory factory = new EncryptMailFactory(EncryptMailFactory.PGP, key_pgp);
        EncryptMail encryptor_smime = factory.getEncryptor();
        ```
    
    - By Certificate: the type of encryptor will be deduced by the format of the given certificate.
        ```
        // SMIME encryptor
        EncryptMailFactory factory = new EncryptSMIME(key_smime);
        EncryptMail encryptor_smime = factory.getEncryptor();
      
        // PGP encryptor
        EncryptMailFactory factory = new EncryptSMIME(key_pgp); 
        EncryptMail encryptor_pgp = factory.getEncryptor(); 
        ```

2. Construct the encrypted email with the given data.
    ``` 
    // Generate mail
    MimeBodyPart mail = encryptor.encryptMultiPart(msg, message);        
    ```
    Where _msg_ is the object to be send with the sender and receiver information, and that will contain the final
    encrypted data.
    And where _message_ is the object that contains the information to be encrypted.
    
    
#### Certificates

In order to use asymetric encryption to encrypt the emails - used by both `PGP` and `S/MIME` - it is neccesary to have,
at least, two keys or certificates. This is known as a public/privated key pair. The idea is to use the public key - that
can be known by anyone - to encrypt the email. This email cannot be decrypted back into plain text with the public
key - this is why anyone can know the public key -, the email can only be decrypted with the privated key that only
the recipient will know - this private key need to be keep secure and if leaked anyone will be able to decypt the email -.


Depending on the standard used to encrypt the email, the key pair will be generated in one of the following ways:


- `S/MIME`: the keypair can be generated using OpenSSL [ [REF](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17583/how-do-i-create-a-valid-email-certificate-for-outlook-s-mime-with-openssl) ]
The private key will need to be installed on the recipient computer in order for the mail client to be able to
decrypt the email.

- `PGP`: the keypair can be generated using the OpenPGP or GNUPGP software; or in some instances like ThunderBird 
using the mail client itself to generate key pairs and exporting public keys for later distribution [ [REF](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/digitally-signing-and-encrypting-messages) ].



#### Logging
Logging has been left to the end user of the library. Instead, when an error occurs the library will return 
an `EncryptMailException` with the issues. The decision to leave the logging task to the end user has been done
mainly to reduce dependencies, and incompatibilities with other logging frameworks or versions.

## Minimal Required JDK
